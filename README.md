## Features
- **Responsive Design:** The page adjusts beautifully on all screen sizes, thanks to Bootstrap’s powerful grid system.
- **Interactive UI:** Hover effects, smooth transitions, and structured content organization.
- **Custom SVG Icons**: I’ve used SVG for precise and scalable icons, adding clarity to the design.
- **Stylish Layout:** Accurate reproduction of the Netflix layout, including carousels, hero sections, and FAQ dropdowns.

## Technologies used
- **HTML5:** For building the structure of the page.
- **CSS3:** For styling and adding custom animations.
- **Bootstrap:** To ensure responsiveness and ease of component handling.
- **SVG:** Used for crisp and scalable icons.
